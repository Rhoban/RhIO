# Rhoban Input/Output Library

![RhIO](Docs/imgs/rhio.gif)

RhIO is a lightweight library that can be linked against your application
in order to interract with your program on-the-fly, through its integrated server.

Main feature are parameters that can be exposed in order to be changed, monitored
or persisted to configuration files. 

We also provide a shell client that will provide a bash-like interface to walk
your nodes and parameters, and even trigger methods that are in your code.
