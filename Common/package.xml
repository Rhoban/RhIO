    in order to interract with your program on-the-fly, through its integrated server.

    Main feature are parameters that can be exposed in order to be changed, monitored
    or persisted to configuration files. 

    It also provide a shell client that will provide a bash-like interface to walk
    your nodes and parameters, and even trigger methods that are in your code.
