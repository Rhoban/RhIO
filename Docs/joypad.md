# Using a joypad with the shell

* pad [GAMEPAD_CONFIG.json]: 
     If run without argument it will display the buttons of the plugged gamepad (useful to configure a new gamepad)
     
     If run with a filename it will run the gamepad control. 
     
     Example of configuration files are located in workspace/env/rhio/ (https://github.com/Rhoban/workspace)
     
     To use the configuration file you should put it into the directory ~/.rhio/ (create it if it doesn't exist)
     
     example: pad xbox_walk.json (have a look at the content of the file for more explanations)
