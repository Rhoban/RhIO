# Rhio Shell in the context of Rhoban robots

   USAGE: rhio [IP_ADDRESS]
   
   If you don't input the IP_ADDRESS parameter, the default value will be 127.0.0.1 (localhost=your computer)
   
   Otherwise you should input the robot's IP_ADDRESS.

   Inside the rhio shell, data are organised as Commands, Directories and Files. You can navigate through the rhio virtual filesystem using the standard *ls* and *cd* commands.
  
   You can also use the autocompletion using the TAB key.

   The main directories are:
   - The */lowlevel* directory contains everything related to the low level system i.e the motors and sensors.
   - The */moves* directory contains everything related to the moves (one sub directory for every move).
   - The */Vision* directory contains everything related to the vision (this directory doesn't exist in novision mode) i.e. one sub directory for every vision filter.
   - The */localisation* directory contains everything related to the localisation and the Particule Filter.

   The main rhio shell commands:

* help:
     shows help on rhio command

* pad [GAMEPAD_CONFIG.json]: 
     If run without argument it will display the buttons of the plugged gamepad (useful to configure a new gamepad)
     
     If run with a filename it will run the gamepad control. Example of configuration files are located in workspace/env/rhio/
     
     To use the configuration file you should put it into the directory ~/.rhio/ (create it if it doesn't exist)
     
     example: pad xbox_walk.json (have a look at the content of the file for more explanations)

* delay: 
     Usage: delay [n secs] [command]
     Delays a command
     example: delay 5 start walk (will start the walk move in 5 seconds)

* repeat: 
     Usage: repeat [command]
     Repeats a command

* diff: 
     Shows the what parameters have changed compared to the stored values

* save:
     Store the parameters.
     The values will be saved in the workspace/env/YOUR_ROBOT/rhio following the same filesystem hierarchy.

* load: 
     Loads the stored parameters values

* plot:
     Plot paramters
     Example: plot lowlevel/imu/yaw lowlevel/head_pitch/position 

* log: 
     Usage: log [param1 [param2 [param3 ...]]] [> filename]
     
     Log values to a csv file. Very similar to plot, but instead of plotting it will save the data.
     
     Example: log lowlevel/imu/yaw lowlevel/head_pitch/position > tmplog (will save the values of imu/yaw and head_pitch/position into the local file tmplog)
     
     Example: 
     - If you want to log the time series of the actual motors position during the walk, you should first initiate the robot and run the walk, then 
     - you can log all the motors you need with for example: log lowlevel/right_knee/position lowlevel/right_ankle_pitch/position 
     - you can also log the motors commands: log lowlevel/right_knee/goalPosition lowlevel/right_ankle_pitch/goalPosition
     - Notice that in fake mode, only the goalPosition is updated.

* plot2d: 
     Usage: x-var y1 [y2 [y3...]]
     Plot 2D parameters
     Example: plot2d lowlevel/right_pressure/x lowlevel/right_pressure/y

* plot3d:
     Usage: x-var y1 y2 [y3 [y4...]]
     Plot 3D parameters

* tune: 
     Usage: tune [var1] [var2] [var3]...
     Run the tuner graphical interface to show/change values

* watch: 
     Continuously watch parameters from the current node

* em:
     Emergency stop. Will power off all motors.

* init:
     Initialize the robot to the zero position on all motors

* infoPlaying:
     Tells informations about the referee (are we playing?)

* team: (from /teamplay/)
     Display information about the current robot state and referee state. These are the same informations than showed in the MonitoringRobocup software.

* tare:
     Performs a pressure sensors calibration. Very important to do while the robot is off the ground.

* gyroTare:
     Performs an IMU sensor calibration. Very important to do while the robot is in walk mode on the ground and without moving.

* stats:
     Gives timings statistics about the MoveScheduler

* view:
     Usage: view [frame]
     View a frame stream. Only in vision mode, in each Vision filter sub directory there is a *out* frame that you can display.
     Example: view /Vision/green/out (will show the result of the green filter)
     
     Some special frames also exists: view /Vision/TaggedImg (shows a summary of the vision computation)
   
   Some rhio shell commands related to the localisation particule filter:

* view /localisation/TopView: shows a summary of the localisation particule filter

* resetPosition: will reset the particule filter with all uniform random positions.

* customReset [X] [Y] [Orientation]: will reset the particule filter at a given X Y Orientation position. Default values are X=0, Y=0, Orientation=0.

* borderReset: will reset the particule filter on the border line on the team side (after a pickup)
